The sole purpose of this application is to record the camera feed of a network camera that supports RTSP.

### ðŸ§  Step 1: Understand RTSP Fundamentals

RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) is a control protocol used to manage streaming sessions between a client (your software) and a media server (the camera). It doesnâ€™t transmit the media itselfâ€”thatâ€™s typically handled by RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol).

**RTSP commands you'll need to implement:**
- `OPTIONS`: Discover supported commands
- `DESCRIBE`: Get stream metadata (usually in SDP format)
- `SETUP`: Negotiate transport (RTP over UDP/TCP)
- `PLAY`: Start streaming
- `RECORD`: Begin recording (if supported by the camera)
- `TEARDOWN`: End session

### ðŸ§± Step 2: Build a Basic RTSP Client

Youâ€™ll need to:
- Open a TCP socket to the cameraâ€™s RTSP port (usually 554)
- Send RTSP requests and parse responses
- Handle session IDs and sequence numbers
- Parse SDP data to extract media stream URLs and codecs

This part is pure C# socket programming and string parsing. Youâ€™ll be implementing a stateful protocol similar to HTTP but with session tracking.

### ðŸŽ¥ Step 3: Handle RTP Media Stream

Once the RTSP `PLAY` command is accepted, the camera starts sending RTP packets. Youâ€™ll need to:
- Open a UDP socket to receive RTP packets
- Parse RTP headers to extract payload (video frames)
- Decode the video stream (e.g., H.264) using a codec library

You can use raw byte manipulation or integrate a decoding library like FFmpeg (though you said no external projectsâ€”so youâ€™d need to write or wrap a decoder yourself).

### ðŸ’¾ Step 4: Record the Video

Once you decode the frames:
- Save them to disk in a container format (e.g., MP4, AVI)
- Implement your own muxer or use a lightweight wrapper around system-level APIs

### ðŸ§ª Step 5: Test with a Known RTSP Stream

Use a test camera or public RTSP stream like:
```
rtsp://wowzaec2demo.streamlock.net/vod/mp4:BigBuckBunny_115k.mov
```

This lets you validate your RTSP and RTP handling before integrating with your actual hardware.
